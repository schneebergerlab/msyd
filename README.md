# pansr

## Usage

Currently, only the core synteny identification part of `pansr` is working.
To run the procedure, an alignment (as SAM, BAM or PAF) of the queries to a reference is necessary as well as the `syri.out` file generated by running `Syri` on the query alignment.

In order to cythonize and compile the cython modules, 
```$ python3 ./setup.py build_ext --inplace```
needs to be run in the main directory.

The files to impute are specified in a tab-separated file with the first column containing the path to the alignment file and the second column the path to the `syri.out` file.
Anything after a `#` is treated as a comment.
See below for an example for identifying core-syntenic regions in the Ampril population.
`pansr` is then called with

```$ python3 ./main.py <path to .tsv input file```

### Example

This example shows how to run `pansr` on the Ampril dataset using the Col accession as a reference.
In this example, all files are in the root folder, but this need not be the case.

For this example, the working directory contains all of the required alignment and `syri` files, as well as this tab-separated table:
\#alns	| syri
- | -
`col_an1.bam`|	`col_an1syri.out`
`col_c24.bam`|	`col_c24syri.out`
`col_eri.bam`|	`col_erisyri.out`
`col_cvi.bam`|	`col_cvisyri.out`
`col_kyo.bam`|	`col_kyosyri.out`
`col_ler.bam`|	`col_lersyri.out`
`col_sha.bam`| 	`col_shasyri.out`

```$ python ./main.py pansr.tsv```
