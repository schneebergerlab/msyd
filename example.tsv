# this is an example tsv file for comparing two haploid genomes from the hgsv dataset
# empty lines, lines beginning with '#' and everything after a '#' in a line is ignored
# columns are tab-separated
# name column contains strings used as organism names
# aln column contains a path to an alignment of that organism against the reference in PAF, SAM or BAM format
# syri column contains a path to the syri.out file generated by running syri on the alignment file with the same reference
# the reference used should be the same for all rows!
