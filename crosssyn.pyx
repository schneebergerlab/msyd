"""
Notes/TODOs

â€“ properly ctype, including range/positions
then write analogous cross synteny class

use find_multisynteny as entry method, should work as-is

intersect will be broadly similar, but keep & increase count instead of dropping.
Do intersect-add and drop in one step, faster and less messy
=> Benchmark, may be very slow
